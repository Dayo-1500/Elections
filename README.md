# Elections
php test website




The files in this repository are my answers to the php test sent to me.

Question one files are: 
a) election.css  b)elections.php    c)server_showpollingunit.php
Later on, I made some corrections to question two so I had to update elections.php because question 1 & 2 share the same frontend script which is elections.php


Question 2 files are:
a)revised-elections.php   b)server_lgaresult.php    c)revised-server_lgaresult.php


Question 3 has only one file which is: 
a) server_sumscore.php
